YoyoMania is the yoyo mod to rule them all! It acts as a modpack for a variety of yoyo mods that haven't been updated to 1.4.4 yet.

The following mods have been ported to 1.4.4 are included in YoyoMania:

- anchiYoyos (10 Yoyos, 1 Accessory) - created by anchikai
- Blink (1 Yoyo) - created by Repost for 99 years of fortune
- GreensMod (2 Yoyos) - created by Comet
- SoManyYoyos (7 Yoyos) - created by LesVibe
- StringTheory (44 Yoyos) - created by LargePotatoHimself
- VanillaYoyoExpansion (7 Yoyos) - created by Lewistheshrk

Total Yoyos: 71
Total Accessories: 1

All credit goes to the original mod authors for creating these mods. I have only ported them to 1.4.4 and made them compatible with each other.
More mods such as yoyo accessory mods will be added soon.
If you have any suggestions for other mods you would like ported, or if you have any issues with the mods in YoyoMania, please let me know in the comments below.
